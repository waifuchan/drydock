/**
 * An abstract interface for ThornBoardDBI - which should be used
 * for board-specific functionality.
 * 
 * Instances of this should probably have board information in an
 * assoc-array stored as the $binfo member.  It might also have a 
 * scalar $payj variable to indicate the current page.  It might also 
 * have date-specific data stored in $on as an array, or possibly
 * even blotter items stored in $blotterentries.

	 * values used for altering the produced output:
	 * 
	 * If $p['full'] == true, all thread information will be fetched.  If false,
	 * only basic information will be returned.  Defaults to false.
	 * 
	 * If $p['sortmethod'] == "id", threads are sorted by ID number.  If "title", threads
	 * are sorted by title alphabetically.  If "bump", threads are sorted by last bumped time.

	 * 
	 * If $p['desc'] == false, the threads are returned in ascending order. Defaults to true.

	 * in a 'date' field with each entry. Defaults to false.
